# stat201
My notes for STAT 201 - Statistical Inference for Data Science! Note: the iteration of the class I took did not have a final project. Also, for our final exam, we were allowed the use of a 2 page double-sided cheat sheet (4 pages total) so I used my entire notes package. Here are my tips for this course!

## Study Tips!
Even if you go into this class having taken upper year stats (like I did), don't skip out on the tutorial. On the worksheets without tests, it's easy to lose a couple of marks here and there. Going to the tutorial and double checking is really beneficial to make sure your logic is correct. Also, many questions on the exams revolved around using definititions and explaining terms. Making a cheatsheet (regardless of whether it may be used) is still a good practice and talking to the prof and TAs during OH and tutorial to practice explaining concepts is useful!

Last but not least, there weren't many practice materials available beyond 1 Canvas question set per exam. Going through worksheets to understand why each formula was used/what each value the question provides corresponds to is beneficial. 

Best of luck!
